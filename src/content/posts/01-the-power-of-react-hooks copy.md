## What is a loss function?

When training a  model, we need a way to measure how well it is performing. This is where loss functions come into play. A loss function is a function that takes the predicted output of a model and compares it to the actual output and the goal is to minimize the difference between the two. This difference is computed after the forward pass. Since the application domain varies greatly, there are many different loss functions that can be used depending on the task at hand. This is specifically important because a Neural Network learns a mapping from inputs to outputs, and the loss function is used to measure how well the model is performing. Further, the configuration of the output layer must also be appropriate for the chosen loss function.

In this small blog posts, I would like to go over the most common loss functions and how to choose the right one for your task.
